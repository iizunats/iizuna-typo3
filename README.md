## What ist iizuna?

Iizuna came from the idea of ​​designing a truly developer-friendly framework.
Many of today's TypeScript frameworks, such as Angular or React, are not designed to be used on pages that rely on old-fashioned server-side rendering.

This framework is really easy to use because it basically consists of only one building block, the component.

These components reflect rough HTML elements.
Selectors (currently only data-attributes) define which elements are decorated with the business-logic you develop.

Additional attributes allow additional configuration of the components, making them easily reusable.
